# Security Policy

## 🔒 Overview

DP-Flash-Attention implements differential privacy mechanisms for machine learning, making security a critical concern. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting process, and privacy-specific security considerations.

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Privacy Guarantees |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | ✅ Current         | ✅ Verified        |
| < 0.1   | ❌ Unsupported     | ⚠️ Unverified     |

**Note**: Given the privacy-critical nature of this library, we recommend always using the latest version for the strongest security posture.

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

## ⏱️ Response Timeline

We are committed to addressing security issues promptly:

| Severity | Response Time | Resolution Target |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Critical | 24 hours      | 7 days           |
| High     | 48 hours      | 14 days          |
| Medium   | 5 business days| 30 days          |
| Low      | 10 business days| 60 days         |

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Privacy guarantee violations, RCE, data exfiltration
- **High**: Authentication bypass, privilege escalation, DoS
