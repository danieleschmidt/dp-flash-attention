## Privacy-Preserving Backup Strategy

### Privacy State Backup
```yaml
Privacy Accounting State:
  - Current epsilon consumption per user/session
  - Delta allocation tracking
  - Noise generation seeds (encrypted)
  - Gradient clipping statistics
  - Privacy budget allocations

Backup Frequency: Real-time (every transaction)
Encryption: AES-256 with separate key management
Retention: 7 years (regulatory requirement)
Verification: Automated integrity checks every hour
```

### Model State Backup
```yaml
Model Checkpoints:
  - Model parameters (encrypted)
  - Training metadata
  - Privacy-preserving statistics only
  - No raw training data
  
Backup Frequency: After each training epoch
Encryption: Model-specific keys
Retention: Latest 10 versions + monthly snapshots
Verification: Model integrity validation
```

### Configuration Backup
```yaml
System Configuration:
  - Privacy parameter settings
  - Security policies
  - Monitoring configurations
  - Access control lists

Backup Frequency: On every change
Storage: Version-controlled Git repositories
Retention: Full history maintained
Verification: Automated deployment testing
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Privacy Accounting Recovery

#### Scenario: Privacy Database Corruption
```bash
# Emergency privacy state recovery
1. Stop all processing immediately
2. Activate emergency privacy accounting service
3. Restore from latest consistent backup
4. Verify privacy guarantee continuity
5. Audit all privacy expenditure since backup
6. Resume processing with verified state
```

#### Recovery Steps:
1. **Assess Impact**
   - Determine data loss extent
   - Calculate privacy budget impact
   - Identify affected users/sessions

2. **Emergency Measures**
   - Halt all privacy-consuming operations
   - Activate backup privacy accounting
   - Preserve any remaining state

3. **State Recovery**
   - Restore from most recent backup
   - Verify backup integrity
   - Reconcile any gaps

4. **Validation**
   - Verify privacy guarantee continuity
   - Check for any privacy violations
   - Validate system functionality

5. **Resume Operations**
   - Restart privacy-consuming services
   - Monitor for issues
   - Update stakeholders

### API Service Recovery

#### Multi-Region Failover
```yaml
Automated Failover:
  - Health check failures trigger DNS switch
  - Traffic routed to healthy region
  - Privacy state synchronized
  - Monitoring alerts sent

Manual Failover:
  - On-call engineer intervention
  - Cross-region state verification
  - Service validation testing
  - User communication if needed
```

### Complete Infrastructure Recovery

#### Cold Site Activation
```bash
# Complete disaster recovery process
1. Activate DR coordination center
2. Notify all stakeholders
3. Assess disaster scope and impact
4. Activate backup infrastructure
5. Restore critical data and configurations  
6. Verify privacy guarantee integrity
7. Resume operations in DR environment
8. Plan primary site recovery
```
