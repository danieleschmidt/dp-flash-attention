   - Prevent further privacy exposure
   - Preserve evidence
   - Implement emergency measures

### Phase 2: Containment and Eradication (15 minutes - 4 hours)

#### Privacy Incident Specific Actions

For P0 Privacy Incidents:
```bash
# Immediate privacy protection measures
1. Stop all processing using affected parameters
2. Revoke API access if necessary
3. Quarantine affected data/models
4. Calculate actual privacy expenditure
5. Assess privacy guarantee violations
```

#### Security Incident Actions
1. **Isolate affected systems**
2. **Patch vulnerabilities**
3. **Remove malicious content**
4. **Update security controls**
5. **Verify system integrity**

#### Evidence Collection
- System logs and metrics
- Privacy budget usage data
- Security scan results
- Network traffic analysis
- User activity logs

### Phase 3: Recovery and Post-Incident (4 hours - ongoing)

#### System Recovery
1. **Verify fix effectiveness**
2. **Restore normal operations**
3. **Monitor for recurrence**
4. **Update security measures**
5. **Validate privacy guarantees**

#### Communication Plan
- **Internal**: Status updates to team
- **Users**: Transparent incident summary
- **Regulators**: Privacy breach notifications (if required)
- **Public**: Security advisory (if needed)

#### Documentation
- Complete incident timeline
- Root cause analysis
- Impact assessment
- Lessons learned
- Process improvements

## Privacy-Specific Procedures

### Privacy Budget Exceeded

```yaml
Detection:
  - Alert: "Privacy budget critically low"
  - Alert: "Privacy budget exceeded"
  - Monitoring: Real-time budget tracking

Response:
  1. Immediate processing halt
  2. Calculate actual privacy expenditure
  3. Assess privacy guarantee implications
  4. Determine if violation occurred
  5. Implement remediation measures
  6. User notification if required

Recovery:
  1. Reset privacy accounting if safe
  2. Implement stronger budget controls
  3. Update monitoring thresholds
  4. Review and adjust parameters
```

### Privacy Parameter Compromise

```yaml
Detection:
  - Invalid privacy parameters detected
  - Unauthorized parameter changes
  - Parameter validation failures

Response:
  1. Revert to known good parameters
  2. Investigate compromise source
  3. Assess impact on privacy guarantees
  4. Implement additional validation
  5. Audit all recent processing

Recovery:
  1. Deploy fixed parameter validation
  2. Re-verify all privacy guarantees
  3. Update security controls
  4. Enhanced monitoring
```

### Data Exposure

```yaml
Detection:
  - Data in logs where it shouldn't be
  - Unauthorized data access
  - Privacy leak in outputs

Response:
  1. Stop data processing immediately
  2. Identify and contain exposed data
  3. Assess privacy impact
  4. Implement data purging if needed
  5. Legal/regulatory consultation
