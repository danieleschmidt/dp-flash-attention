# 0000. Use Architecture Decision Records

Date: 2025-01-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project. Architecture decisions are fundamental design choices that affect the entire system and are difficult to change later.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document architectural decisions made in the DP-Flash-Attention project.

An ADR is structured as follows:
- **Title**: Short noun phrase describing the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?
- **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by this change?

ADRs will be numbered sequentially and stored in the `docs/adr/` directory.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Architectural decisions are documented and can be referenced by team members
- New team members can understand the reasoning behind current architecture
- Decisions can be revisited and updated as the project evolves
- Creates a historical record of architectural evolution

### Negative
- Requires discipline to maintain and update ADRs
- Additional overhead for architectural changes

### Neutral
- ADRs become part of the project documentation and review process
